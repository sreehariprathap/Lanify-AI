# Lanify Backend Documentation

## Environment Setup

### Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- Virtual environment (optional but recommended)
- Docker (for development database)

### Installation

1. Start the PostgreSQL database using Docker:

   ```bash
   cd dev
   docker compose -f docker-compose/dev.yml up -d
   ```

   This will start a PostgreSQL database with the following configuration:
   - Host: localhost
   - Port: 5432
   - Database: lanify
   - Username: postgres
   - Password: postgres

   The database data will be persisted in a Docker volume named `lanify_db_data`.

2. Ensure you are in the codebase directory (`dev/`).

3. Create and activate a virtual environment:

   #### Using venv

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
   venv\Scripts\activate     # On Windows
   ```

   #### Using conda

    ```bash
    conda create --name lanify python=3.9
    conda activate lanify
    ```

4. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. Apply database migrations:

   ```bash
   flask db upgrade
   ```

---

## Running the Application

1. Make sure the database is running. If not, start it:

   ```bash
   docker compose -f docker-compose/dev.yml up -d
   ```

2. Run the application:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

By default, the application runs at [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/).

To access the API documentation, visit [http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui](http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui).

### Stopping the Application and Database

1. To stop the application, press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal where it's running.

2. To stop the database:

   ```bash
   docker compose -f docker-compose/dev.yml down
   ```

   Add `-v` flag to also remove the persisted data volume:
   ```bash
   docker compose -f docker-compose/dev.yml down -v
   ```

## Database Management with Flask-Migrate

Before running any commands below, make sure you are in the root directory of the codebase (`dev/`).

### Create a Migration File

Whenever you add, delete or update a model:

```bash
flask db migrate -m "Describe changes"
```

### Apply Migrations (Upgrade Database Schema)

Run the following command to apply all migrations:

```bash
flask db upgrade
```

> **Note:** It is important to run `flask db upgrade` after pulling changes from the repository to ensure that the
> database schema is up-to-date.

### Rollback to Previous State

If needed, revert to the previous migration:

```bash
flask db downgrade
```

### Check Current Migration Status

```bash
flask db current
```

### View All Migration History

```bash
flask db history
```

---

## Updating or Adding a Model

1. Modify or add a new model in `models/`
2. Run:
   ```bash
   flask db migrate -m "Added new model or updated fields"
   flask db upgrade
   ```
